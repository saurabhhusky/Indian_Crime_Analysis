State-wise crime data from 2001-2014 is classified according to 30+factors.
The dataset contains information on different categories of crime in India based on which we could build we can forecast models. 
Information like State, District, and Year available along with Total IPC Crimes, Rapes, Murders, Kidnapping among major variables. 
Consists of 34 columns and 10678 rows

Goals:
Clean and Preprocess dataset
Perform EDA 
Build predictive models
Research questions:
Which is the most prevalent crime in India?
How is the trend for crimes against women?
Which state and districts account for most cases of rapes?
Build linear and logistic regression modelsto predict crimes
